Really hard to guess how much of this will have actually worked.

- Generated a short story using an LLM.
- Have not read the short story because I have 0 interest in reading things generated by LLM's. 
- The poisoning of information sources by LLM's should mean that anytime you get a bad search result you're allowed to punch 1 Sam Altman and he has to put $1 in a bucket until there's enough money to payback all the people who's work he's profited off. Then we can use the bucket to bail out some of the houses flooded by the increased global warming he's personally encouraging. 
- Hopefully Raph has read the story out loud meaning I've heard it for the first time.

- If things have worked at all the [Web Speech Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) will start listening on mousemove
- If it has started and understood the accent of a monsieur oiseau it's listening out for the words "fish sauce"
- If it hears them and understands them it should display a 3d model.
- That has been accuratly generated by the latest in AI technology to give a [3D model from a still photo ](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jiawei011/dreamgaussian)
- We now know drinking fish sauce will cronenberg movie your back parts. 

***

- If things have not worked you can hover over the phrase "Fishermans Curse" to display the model.
